Important Notes
---------------
1. The RatMD.BlogHub extension adds the possibility to use author archive pages. It is highly 
recommended using the "Author Slug" field for each backend user so that the login name - which would 
be used instead - is not disclosed. You can also disable the use of the login name with the 
`[bloghubBase]` component, as described in the documentation.

2. The Blog comments currently requires to add the `{% framework %}` October-specific TWIG tag to 
your template layouts, when not already included. We're working on an AJAX-less / -optional 
solution for a future update.
